The secret to burrito bowls is the base: either cilantro lime long-grain rice or sweet potatos. Everything else you just add whatever and however much looks delicious to you. This meal can be done completely from scratch (DIY salsa and guacamole, grilling corn on the cob, having pre-made beans, etc.) or on the quick (pre-made salsa and guacamole, canned items, etc.), it really doesn't matter.


### Ingredients
- Long grain white rice, like jasmin or basmati
  - You could do 2 small sweet potatos per adult human instead:
    - Clean them, then slice in half and toss in coconut or olive oil and bake on a sheet until soft (~15-20 minutes on 350)
- One bunch of cilantro
- One lime
- Salt (I use pink Himalayan but garlic salt is great too)
- Pepper
- Optional spices: garlic powder, chile lime powder, etc.
- 1 can of black beans (or pinto), drained (or whatever protein you prefer)
- Pico de gallo (recipe incoming, but use your own, google one, or buy it pre-made)
- Any other salsas you like (chipotle, tomatillo, etc.)
- 1 can of corn (in the summer I use fresh and grill it)
- Guacamole (recipe incoming, but use your own, google one, buy it pre-made, or just do sliced avocado)
- Whatever else sounds good: jalape√±o slices, Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream, grilled veggies, etc.

### Directions
#### Start the rice
- Rinse dry rice until the water isn't very cloudy (this removes some of the starch)
- Put rice in rice cooker, about 1/2 c per adult human, with 2x + a little extra water
  - For two adult humans, I'd do 1 c dry rice and 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 c water
  - Stir rice in water inside the cooker before placing the lid

#### While the rice is cooking
- Rough cut up your cilantro
- Drain your beans (or cook your protein of choice) and corn
- Make your pico and guac (or don't!)
- Grab and prep whatever else you want in your bowl

#### Finish the rice
- Squirt 1/2 lime juice
- Toss in some cilantro (whatever amount looks good)
- Season with salt and pepper (and optional garlic powder or whatever you like)
- Stir it up 

#### Assemble deliciousness
- Scoop rice into bowl
- Add beans
- Add corn
- Add salsa(s)
- Add guac
- Add cheese/sour cream/etc. 
- Season with cilantro, salt 'n' peppa, etc. and squirt with remaining fresh lime
